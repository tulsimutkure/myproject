  <p class="w3-center"><em>I love photography</em></p>
  <p>Photography is one of the ways to show their creative skills and life from a different outlook.   
    There are several factors that determines the value of any image such as its color, lighting, creativity, its distinctiveness, background, 
    charm, shooting time, shooting location, and the meaning that hides behind it. These are also the factors that differentiates an ordinary image from
     an impactful one. It is an art that helps in capturing beautiful moments in life, and cherish for future. It can be a natural scenery, a painting,
      an expression, a building, etc.</p>

      <p>Welcome to my website. I am here to tell u about photography with little pinch of salt. More than representing reality, 
        this art is also beneficial in various other spheres of life. A well clicked photograph has the potential to influence people,
         or making an impressive reputation of a specific firm, or brand. Photographs also have a big impact on emotions of people. 
         The images they click helps in connecting people to each other. Where some photographers click it for casual purpose, others 
         want to reveal deep hidden meaning behind their creations.
        <br>

         Every image tells a specific story to people. It should not be overlooked.  Photograph has the power to influence the people. A few people use
          it in the form of their weapon to bring about the issues in the society and control the vulnerable people. Image can get attention from people, 
          and can even lead to shock, sadness, aggression, uncertainty, and stress.
        <br>
        The art of photography helps people to record reality. Being a science, and art, it has constantly improved by several inventors, artists, 
        engineers, and scientists. Photography is an art that is referred to as “drawing with light”. There are several sorts of photography that 
        includes satellite, monochrome, panoramic, and underwater.</p>
